# CI/CD setup and deployment

1. Manual application deployment on the server (instructions for future use...)

- Access the server via SSH (PuTTY used for this)

- Remember to always start by updating the system

```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade -y
```

- Make sure Node.js, npm, git and pm2 are installed

```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  pm2 -v
  git --version
```

- Clone the repository into the home directory

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Elliriskala/node-ci.git
  cd node-ci
```

- Set up the DB by login into MariaDB and run

``` bash
  sudo mysql -u root -p
```

```sql
  CREATE DATABASE cicdtest;
  CREATE USER '<DB_USER>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<DB_PASS>';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cicdtest.* TO '<DB_USER>'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  USE cicdtest;
  CREATE TABLE students (
      student_id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      student_name text NOT NULL,
      filename text NOT NULL,
      birthdate date NOT NULL
  );
  COMMIT;
```

- Set up .env file

```ini
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=<DB_USER>
  DB_PASS=<DB_PASS>
  DB_NAME=cicdtest
  PORT=3000
```

- Install Node modules and build the app

```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
```

2. Configure Apache reverse proxy (HTTP & HTTPS)

- Enable necessary modules

```bash
  sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http headers
  sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

- Edit the default virtual host

```bash
  sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

```apache
  <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
      ServerName ucad-server-https.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com

      ProxyPreserveHost On
      ProxyRequests Off
      ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/
      ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000/

      ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
      CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
  </VirtualHost>
```

- Restart Apache to aply changes
``` bash
  sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

3. Enable HTTPS with Certbot (it will automatically configure \*:443)

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
sudo certbot --apache
```

- Follow prompts and select correct domain
- Verify HTTPS: https://ucad-server-https.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com

4. Setup pm2 to keep the application running

- Start the app using pm2

```bash
  pm2 start dist/src/index.js --name cicd-deploy
  pm2 save
```

- Setup pm2 to restart on server reboot

```bash
  sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u <USERNAME> --hp /home/<USERNAME>
  pm2 save
```

- Verify pm2 list:

```bash
  pm2 list
```

- The app must be started manually with pm2 once before GitHub Actions can restart it.

5. Setup SSH keys for GitHub actions

- Generate SSH key pair on the server

```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -C "github-actions-node" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa-github-node
```

- Pressed Enter twice as I didn't want to add a passphrase
- Public key saved: ~/.ssh/id_rsa-github-node.pub
- Private key saved: ~/.ssh/id_rsa-github-node

- Add public key to authorized_keys on the server

```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa-github-node.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

6. Create GitHub Actions workflow
- Add the private key and other secrets to GitHub
  In the project repository go to Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> New repository secret and add:

  - Name: PRIVATE_KEY
  - Value: paste the private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa-github-node

  - Name: HOST
  - Value: the server IP or domain

  - Name: USERNAME
  - Value: server username

- Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml

```yaml
name: Node.js CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Deploy using ssh
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
          port: 22
          script: |
            cd ~/node-ci
            git pull origin main
            npm install
            npm run build
            npm run test
            npm run apidoc
            pm2 restart cicd-deploy
```

7. Test the deployment pipeline

- Make sure the server is running...
- Add, commit and push changes to main
- Check GitHub actions â†’ workflow logs
- Verify server app is running

```bash
  pm2 list
  curl https://ucad-server-https.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/api/v1
```

- Or visit https://ucad-server-https.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/api/v1

- Should see

```json
{"message": "routes: students"}
```

# Simple Node CI/CD demo including integration testing

Tests & code based on <https://github.com/ilkkamtk/integration-testing-ready>

## Testing Scenarios

Testing successful API responses and error handling. The test cases for both scenarios are provided in the test folder.

## 1. Prerequisites

1. Create a new repository using this as a template (click _Use this template_ button on top of the main page of [this repository](https://github.com/mattpe/node-ci-intro))
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies with `npm install`
1. Create a database and a user for the application (example script: [db/create-db.sql](./db/create-db.sql))
   - NOTE: default username and password should be changed and not shared publicly in the repo, use environment variables instead
1. Create `.env` file in the root of the project (see `.env.example` for reference)
1. Run tests with `npm test` locally and make sure they pass

## 2. Setting up first CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

1. Open the repository in GitHub in a browser and choose `Actions` from the top menu
   - Browse the available CI/CD templates and choose `Node.js` as the template
   - Commit the suggested changes to the repository
   - Pull the changes to your local repository
1. View & edit the `.github/workflows/node.js.yml` [yaml](https://yaml.org/) file and update the content according your needs
   - Set correct Node.js versions
   - Think about the phases you want to include in your pipeline, e.g. build, test, deploy..?
   - Refer to `package.json` for available scripts, e.g. `test:unit`, What will work on GitHub Actions platform and what is neeeded?
1. Test actions by committing the changes and pushing them to the remote repository, check the status of the actions in GitHub
1. Add other phases to the pipeline, e.g. use of Github secrets, tests including db, deployment to a server (see example below)
   - Add description of your implementations (or trials and errors) to the beginning of `README.md` in your repository

### Tips

- You can set up multiple actions for different purposes, e.g. one for CI and another for CD or you can use multiple jobs in a single action, e.g. one for testing and another for deployment
- You can test and modify ready-made actions from GitHub, just click _New workflow_ on the Actions page to browse them
- You can set Node's `process.env` variables in the action using `env:` directive, e.g.

  ```yaml
  ---
  - run: npm run test:unit
    env:
      NODE_ENV: development
  ```

- You can create a temporary `.env` file in the action using `run:` directive, e.g.

  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Create .env file
    run: |
      echo "DB_HOST=localhost" >> .env
      echo "DB_PORT=3306" >> .env
      echo "DB_NAME=testdb" >> .env
      echo "DB_USER=testuser" >> .env
      echo "DB_PASSWORD=testpassword" >> .env
  ```

- Replacing hardcoded values with [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets), e.g.

  ```yaml
  echo "DB_USER=${{ secrets.DB_USER }}" >> .env
  echo "DB_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}" >> .env
  ```

- Ubuntu image used by GitHub Actions has MySQL pre-installed, you can add steps to start the MySQL service and create a database and user for testing, e.g.

  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Start MySQL service
    run: sudo service mysql start

  - name: Create test database and user
    run: |
      mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE testdb;"
      mysql -e "CREATE USER 'testuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'testpassword';"
      mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON testdb.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';"
      mysql -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
  ```

- Adding `env:` directive to set environment variables for the whole job, e.g.

  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      env:
        NODE_ENV: development
        DB_HOST: localhost
        DB_PORT: 3306
        DB_NAME: testdb
        DB_USER: testuser
        DB_PASSWORD: testpassword
  ```

- These can be referenced in the action steps as `${{ env.DB_USER }}` etc.

## 3. Example of setting up a CD pipeline for a Server (e.g. Virtual Machine in Azure)

1. First, deploy the application on the server manually
   - make sure you have a server running and you can pull the repository from GitHub (without a need type password) and run the application
   - Clone the repository (into folder `~/node-ci-example` in this example)
     - if the repo is private, you need to [setup ssh authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). Easiest way to avoid passphrase prompts is to create the key without a passphrase (for added layer of security you may use passphrase and store it to your [ssh agent](https://gist.github.com/nepsilon/45fae11f8d173e3370c3))
   - Create the database and user for the application
   - Create and edit `.env` file
   - Test run app & run tests manually
   - Setup web server like Apache as a reverse proxy (see server deployment instructions from previous courses)
   - Use `pm2` to keep the application running, remember to add a name for the application `pm2 start app.js --name node-ci-example`
1. Automatic deployment is done on the server side by running terminal commands over SSH connection too
1. Create a new SSH key pair on the server for authenticating with the server using GitHub action
   - Generate a new key pair with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -C "github-actions-node"`
   - Copy the public key `~/.ssh/id_rsa-github-node.pub` to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
   - Copy the private key `~/.ssh/id_rsa-github-node` to the repository secrets (use name `PRIVATE_KEY`) in GitHub (_Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> New repository secret_)
   - Add other necessary properties to the repository secrets
     - `HOST`: IP address or domain name of the server
     - `USERNAME`: your username on the server
1. Create a new action in the `.github/workflows` folder, e.g. `deploy.yml`:

   - SSH connection from GitHub is established using the 3rd party [`appleboy/ssh-action`](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action)

   ```yaml
   name: Node.js CD

   # Controls when the action will run.
   on:
     # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
     push:
       branches: [main]

   # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
   jobs:
     # This workflow contains a single job called "deploy"
     deploy:
       # The type of runner that the job will run on
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
       steps:
         - name: Deploy using ssh
           uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
           with:
             # connect to server using credentials stored in github secrets
             host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
             username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
             key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
             port: 22
             script: |
               # after login to server go to application folder
               cd ~/ci-node-example
               # pull the changes from Github
               git pull origin main
               # to get the status and to check that everything is ok
               git status
               # install possibly updated dependencies
               npm install
               # run all test suites
               npm run test
               # generate apidocs
               npm run apidoc
               # finally, restart the application using the updated version of it
               pm2 restart node-ci-example
   ```

1. Test by committing the changes and pushing them to the remote repository, check the status of the action in GitHub.
